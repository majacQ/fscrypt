# Encrypt as root with user's login protector

IMPORTANT: See "MNT/dir/fscrypt_recovery_readme.txt" for
           important recovery instructions. It is *strongly recommended* to
           record the recovery passphrase in a secure location; otherwise you
           will lose access to this directory if you reinstall the operating
           system or move this filesystem to another system.
